# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for the Deep Learning Specialization offered by deeplearning.ai through Coursera. All the base code is taken from [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
